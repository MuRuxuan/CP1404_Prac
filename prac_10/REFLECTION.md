# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
At the very beginning, my estimates were extremely inaccurate. I often thought, "I can finish this feature in two hours," but ended up spending the entire afternoon just debugging. Later, I learned my lesson: I double the estimated time for simple features and triple it for complex ones.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
There was a noticeable improvement. Initially, the discrepancy was absurd—once I estimated a task would take 3 hours, but it actually took me 8. Later, I learned to break down tasks into smaller, more detailed steps and estimate the time for each individual step separately, which significantly boosted the accuracy of my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
My biggest takeaway was realizing that coding only accounts for half of the total time; "side tasks" like testing, bug fixing, and documentation actually take up more time. Now, I always set aside buffer time when making plans.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Having my code reviewed was quite awkward at first. I always thought my code was good, but others could spot problems at a glance. However, I truly learned a lot from this process—for example, variable names shouldn’t be arbitrary, and writing comments is really crucial.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Reading others’ code made me realize that everyone has different programming habits. Some coding styles never crossed my mind, but they were indeed more elegant. I also learned how to give suggestions without offending others, such as pointing out the strengths first before proposing improvements.

### Good Code Review 1
prac_07/guitar.py

### Explanation
I pointed out a bug related to edge cases in fuel calculation and also suggested replacing magic numbers with constants. Most importantly, I provided specific modification suggestions instead of just saying "there’s a problem here."

### Good Code Review 1
prac_09/musician.py

### Explanation
I suggested adding more test cases for abnormal scenarios and also shared a similar bug I had encountered before. Later, the author replied that they had indeed found a hidden issue thanks to this.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would reduce the number of repetitive small tasks and arrange more group collaboration projects. Coding alone is completely different from working with others, and the latter is much more similar to real-world work scenarios.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I developed the habit of testing while writing code, unlike before when I would write all the code in one go and then debug it. Additionally, I persisted in writing clear commit messages, which made it much easier to trace issues later.
